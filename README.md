## Problem Statement

MIT Indoor Scenes (MITIS)[1] is an image dataset with 67 indoor categories. We propose to compare five Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies to predict the indoor category of the MITIS images and evaluate the quality of predictions using different evaluation matrices. To improve prediction quality in traditional classification models, we propose to use Deep Learning Neural Network (DNN) based feature extractors. In this work, we present a comparison of different AI models based on their classification accuracies on MITIS dataset.

We propose following well known models to classify the MITIS dataset. 
 * Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)[3]
 * Support Vector Machine (SVM)[2]
 * Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [2]
 * Random Forest (RF)[2]
 * Naive Bayes[2]


## Experimental Setup
We propose to use a confusion matrix to evaluate each model.
