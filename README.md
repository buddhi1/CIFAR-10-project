# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Different Artificial Intelligent Models

Group Members: Desiree Garcia, Buddhi Ashan Mallika Kankanamalage, Heila Shahidi, Paul Woody, Mark Zimmerschied


We propose following well known models to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest (RF)

# Experimental Setup
We chose the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
We propose to use K-cross validation for all models that we are going to generalize the prediction. 
We propose to use a confusion matrix to evaluate each model.
